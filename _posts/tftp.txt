Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) Installation.

   Posted on November 26, 2016 by VinayMahadev

   Install and Test TFTP Server in Host Ubuntu machine:

     *  TFTP, a lightweight file transfer protocol, uses other software to get running: xinetd.
     * The xinetd program performs  a neat job:  it waits for  network connections on  ports (as specified  in the/etc/services file)  and, when  a
       connection occurs, remaps the standard in  and out to the read and write of the network connection.
     * This trick means that the program run by  xinetd has code that uses file semantics (like scanf()  and printf()) and reads and writes over  a
       network connection.
     * Not all distributions have xinetd installed by default, so you may need to install it using your distribution’s package-management system.

   1. Install following packages.

 $ sudo apt-get install xinetd tftpd tftp

   2. Create /etc/xinetd.d/tftp and put this entry

 # default: off
 # description: The tftp server serves files using the trivial file transfer
 # protocol. The tftp protocol is often used to boot diskless
 # workstations, download configuration files to network-aware printers,
 # and to start the installation process for some operating systems.
 service tftp
 {
 socket_type = dgram
 protocol = udp
 wait = yes
 user = root
 server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
 server_args = -s /tftpboot
 disable = no
 per_source = 11s
 cps = 100 2
 }

   The lines of interest in this file are server_args, which indicates the directory where TFTP stores and looks for files. The kernel that is
   downloaded to the board needs to be placed in this directory.

   3. Create a folder /tftpboot this should match whatever you gave in server_args. mostly it will be tftpboot

 $ sudo mkdir /tftpboot
 $ sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot
 $ sudo chown -R nobody /tftpboot

   4. Restart the xinetd service.

 $ sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart

   Now  tftp server will be up and starts running.

   5. Create a file named test with some content in /tftpboot path of the tftp server

 $ touch   /tftpboot/test
 $ sudo chmod -R 777 /tftpboot

   Obtain the ip address of the tftp server using: ifconfig command.

   example we will consider the ip address as 192.168.1.2

   6. Now in some other terminal and folder  follow the following steps.

 $ tftp 192.168.1.2
 tftp> get test
 Sent 159 bytes in 0.0 seconds
 tftp> quit
 $ ls test

   You can try the same test on another computer on the network, to ensure that you can connect to the host from another machine (across the  wire,
   as a network-person would say). If TFTP works from localhost but not from another computer, chances are the firewall is still running. Stop this
   service, and try again.

   Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
